- 👋 Hi, I’m Phil.
- 👀 Interested in learning and collaborating on useful, practical numerical software for Engineers & Scientists.
- 🌱 I’m currently refreashing skills on C++, learning CUDA; wxWidgets, GTK4, Qt, and Electron/NodeJS/V8 for GUI's. And using Python a lot!
- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on solving, at the core, matrix and linear algebra projects, scientific computation, with many applications in all forms of engineering. I work daily on Linux, Windows 10, and occasionally on my older MacBook, Intel x86.
